# Nexter.github.io
Nexter is a project I completed for a course I undertook. The web page revolves around a top real estate company. During this project I built the entire site from scratch while creating responsiveness for it to be viewed easily on a laptop, tablet or mobile phone. 


This project is from this course: https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/v4/overview
